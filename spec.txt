I need to write a GAE application which allows a fixed set of users (and credentials) to start one machine per user
on GCP. Each user will login, and see if his/her machine is up or down, and be able to press a button to bring his
machine up if it is down. At the begining no machines should be up. When a machine is brought up it should stay up for
1-3 hours according to the users choice and then turn itself off.

Authentication can be done with a hardcoded list of users and passwords.
use python and flask.
use constants for app name, zone and client_id.

Use hardcoded list of names and passwords, dont use oauth, firebase or any of that.

Write two scripts: one is the web app and one is a script to create the data store behind the app from the command line.
