I need to write a GAE application which allows to suspend/resume all my machines in a project on GCP.
It will show all my machines with name, labels and external ips, and the state of the machine
Pressing the machine will change it's state from running to suspended, and from suspended to running.
The list of machines should be taken from GCP using API.

language is python with flask.

use constants for app name, zone and client_id.
No need for any data store.
